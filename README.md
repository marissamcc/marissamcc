**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating ‚Äúuser stories‚Äù help with this?**

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

There are multiple ways to develop programs: the waterfall method is useful where there is a specific strategy used for a project. Additionally, the Agile methodology is a more commonly used method that allows for more flexibility and client integration.
