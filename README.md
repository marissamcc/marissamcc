Hi, I‚Äôm @marissamcc I like problem solving, statistics, video gaming and cooking.
- üëÄ I'm currently an appraisal supervisor and full time Computer Science major.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ... EVERYTHING.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking forward to learning more C++ and Python, especially in regards to databases.

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating ‚Äúuser stories‚Äù help with this?**

Interpreting user needs begins with figuring out what the user's their expectations through user stories. User stories help identify the basic needs for a program and help the team determine priorities and backlog.

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

There are multiple ways to develop programs: the waterfall method is useful where there is a specific strategy used for a project. Additionally, the Agile methodology is a more commonly used method that allows for more flexibility and client integration.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

Effective communication is a key part of being a good team member in software development. It's also important to understand your role within the team and actively contribute to the team's goals. Collaboration, problem-solving, and a willingness to learn and adapt are essential qualities.

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**

This project was to create a program that took a text file of information about a grocery store's inventory and allowed the user to input the name of the item that they wanted to know the inventory count of.
**What did you do particularly well?**

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**

I need to make my code more readable by declaring variables together and to work on improving my while true loops.

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**

For me, the hardest part is reading a file and creating a file. I've mostly figured out the reading file portion, but I'm having trouble making the create file. 

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**

I've learned some valuable tools from the feedback provided as well as learned as I was working on this project. I've figured out the reading of a file, and the continuous string in the user prompt - instead of just reading one word at a time.

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

Part of the feedback received was that I needed to make it more readable, but after reviewing the code I see where I can make it more readable by declaring variables together.
